# Quantity Types

This library implements strongly typed physical quantities along with a variety of operators that operate on the quantities. The concept and the basis for implementation is from the __Unit Independent Types Subsystem__ presented in the [Naval Research Laboratory's](https://www.nrl.navy.mil) publication on [GeoLib](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/AD1170763.pdf). The library modifies and extends the design presented in GeoLib in several ways.

The benefit of using this library is that it allows you to use and manipulate various physical quantities without tracking the corresponding units for each quantity.
